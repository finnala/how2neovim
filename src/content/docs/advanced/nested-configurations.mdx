description: How you can nest your Neovim configurations with Lua modules

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If you are using the `lua/` folder to organize your Neovim configuration, your current setup might look something like this:

<FileTree>

- init.lua
- lazy-lock.json
- lua
    - keymaps.lua
    - settings.lua
    - mason-setup.lua
    - treesitter-setup.lua
    - lualine-setup.lua
    - plugins-setup.lua

</FileTree>

And your `init.lua` file might have a *huge* amount of imports, for example:

```lua
require("keymaps")
require("settings")
require("treesitter-setup.lua")
require("mason-setup.lua")
require("plugins-setup.lua")
require("lualine-setup.lua")
```

This may still feel a little unorganized. There are a couple methods to clean up your Lua configuration, as follows.

### Using directories and dot notation

With Lua modules, you can create subdirectories within your `lua/` directory. For example:

<FileTree>

- init.lua
- lazy-lock.json
- lua
    - core
        - keymaps.lua
        - settings.lua
    - lsp
        - mason-setup.lua
        - treesitter-setup.lua
    - plugins
        - lualine-setup.lua
        - plugins-setup.lua

</FileTree>

Which cleans up the `lua/` directory nicely.

To relfect these changes, in your `init.lua` you will need to update the `require` statements to include the subdirectories.

```lua
require("core.keymaps")
require("core.settings")
require("lsp.treesitter-setup.lua")
require("lsp.mason-setup.lua")
require("plugins.plugins-setup.lua")
require("plugins.lualine-setup.lua")
```

However, our `init.lua` file is still the same. If this works for you - great! If you want to clean up your `init.lua` file as well, read the next method.

### Using directories and init.lua files

This takes a similar approach to the previous method, but in each `lua/` subdirectory, you also create an `init.lua` file.

<FileTree>

- init.lua
- lazy-lock.json
- lua
    - core
        - init.lua
        - keymaps.lua
        - settings.lua
    - lsp
        - init.lua
        - mason-setup.lua
        - treesitter-setup.lua
    - plugins
        - init.lua
        - lualine-setup.lua
        - plugins-setup.lua

</FileTree>

In each respective nested `init.lua`, you can require that directory's files.

For example, in `plugins/init.lua` your code would be:

```lua
require("lualine-setup")
require("plugins-setup")
```

And the same pattern follows for each `lua/` subdirectory.

In your top-level `init.lua` file, you can now use the following `require` statements:

```lua
require("core")
require("lsp")
require("plugins")
```

Which makes the configuration a lot cleaner.

<Aside type="caution" title="require order">
Remember that the order you `require` parts of your configuration is important. You may want to `require` your keymaps and other settings before plugins, and plugins before your LSP settings etc. Also remember that the order of statements in each subdirectory is also important.
