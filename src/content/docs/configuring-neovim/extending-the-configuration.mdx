description: How init.lua works and writing your first configuration.

So we have an `init.lua` file with some initial settings, but we *probably* don't want to store our entire configuration in here.

Why?

If you want to add plugins, custom keybinds, and other features, keeping it in a single file can get a bit messy. In this instance, you may want to swap to a different approach to keep your configuration more organized.

<Aside type="note">
Reminder: **There is no right or wrong way to configure Neovim**. If you have a minimal configuration, sticking with `init.lua` is just fine. This is meant to be a guide on learning how Neovim works, rather than a specific setup.
</Aside>

### The Lua directory

Some of the previous directories we saw —  for your keymaps, color schemes, and plugins — might seem appealing to you for organization.

However, we recommend setting up your configuration in the `lua/` directory.

### Why The Lua Directory?

If you’ve ever looked at other Neovim configurations or tutorials, this is the directory that you’ve probably seen the most.

Here are the two main reasons to opt for the `lua/` directory over the other individual runtime directories:

- Better organization and modularity so everything is in one place.
- `lua/` can run **any** valid Lua code you want → much more flexible.


### Moving The Initial Configuration Code

Let's take the following code from our [Writing an Initial Configuration](/configuring-neovim/writing-an-initial-configuration) section.

```lua
local opt = vim.opt

opt.cursorline = true
opt.number = true
opt.relativenumber = true
opt.termguicolors = true
```

Remove this code from your `init.lua` file in preparation to move it into your new `lua/` configuration.

Then perform the following steps from within your `~/.config/nvim` directory.

```sh
mkdir lua
cd lua
touch settings.lua
```

This code:
1. Creates the `lua/` directory
2. Changes into the directory
3. Creates a new file called `settings.lua`

<Aside type="note">
Your file does not have to be called `settings.lua`. Call it whatever you want!
</Aside>

Your `.config/nvim` folder should now look something like this:

<FileTree>

- nvim
  - init.lua
  - lua/
    - settings.lua

</FileTree>

### Using Your New Configuration and Lua Modules

When you create configuration files in the `lua/` directory, Neovim doesn't automatically run them.

Files in this directory are treated as [Lua modules](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/lua_modules.htm), so they must be imported into our original `init.lua` file to be used.

#### Importing the Configuration File

To do this, simply add the following line to your `init.lua` file:

```lua
require("settings")
```

Notice that you do not need to pass in the entire file path, or the `.lua` extension.

### The Basis of Neovim Configuration

The steps you have just taken from the basis of any large Neovim configuration. Great job!

It's up to you to decide which files you want to create in your `lua/` directory and what to store where - and don't forget to `require` them in your `init.lua` file.

Here's an example of what a more complex setup may look like:

<FileTree>
- core
  - keymaps.lua
  - settings.lua
- lsp
  - mason-setup.lua
  - treesitter-setup.lua
- plugins
  - autopairs-setup.lua
  - gitsigns-setup.lua
  - lualine-setup.lua
  - nvim-tree.lua
  - plugins-setup.lua
  - tsautotag-setup.lua

</FileTree>

Which we'll get into configuring!
