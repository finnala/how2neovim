Neovim, like a lot of other linux/unix programs, is configured through a userâ€™s [dotfiles](/reference/dotfiles).

You can create dotfiles which change the default settings in Neovim, initialize plugins, set colorschemes, and more.

When you open up Neovim, it will look for these dotfiles to load your Neovim configuration.

One of the most important files it will look for is the `init.lua` file.


### Create an init.lua file

On startup, Neovim looks for an `init.lua` file in your **config** directory (`~/.config/nvim`).

If you don't already have one, create the directory with the following command:

```sh
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
```

And from your home directory, enter it with:

```sh
cd .config/nvim
```

From here, run `touch init.lua` to create your initial configuration file.

You can learn more about how this works by opening Neovim and typing `:h lua-guide`, and scrolling to `lua-guide-config`.
</Aside>

### Testing Your Initial Configuration File

Open up your new `init.lua` file with `nvim init.lua`.

Enter insert mode with `I` and type the follwing:

```lua
print("Hello World!")
```

Then go back to normal mode with `Esc`, and type `:wq` to save and quit the file.

*You could also use :luafile % to source the current buffer, but weâ€™ll keep it simple for now.*
</Aside>

Re-open the file with `nvim init.lua`, and you should see "Hello World!" at the bottom of your terminal. ðŸŽ‰
