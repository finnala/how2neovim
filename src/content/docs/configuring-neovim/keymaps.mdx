Setting custom keymaps in Neovim is common, as you may want to download plugins with additional functionality, and bind some of their commands to certain key mappings.

In Vim and Neovim, there is a special key specially created for custom user commands: the **leader key**.

### Remapping the Leader Key

By default, the leader is set to backslash (`\`).

This doesn't feel very intuitive for some people, so is often remapped to `space`.

To remap the leader key, simply add the following line of code to your configuration:

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

### Configuration Examples

<Aside type="caution" title="Choose Your Leader Key Carefully">
If you decide to remap the leader key to something other than `space`, make sure it doesn't clash with any of the default keys used in Vim's normal mode.
