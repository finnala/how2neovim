title: Writing an inital configuration
description: Setting up some initial settings for Neovim in the init.lua file.

Letâ€™s start by creating some very simple settings that you might want for your Lua configuration. Open up your `init.lua` file and add the following code:

```lua
local opt = vim.opt

opt.cursorline = true
opt.number = true
opt.relativenumber = true
opt.termguicolors = true
```

### What Does It Do?

This code:
- Creates a variable called `opt`, which maps to the global options available in vim
- Sets a cursorline
- Sets (relative) line numbers which are useful
- Uses true colors for the terminal

<Aside type="tip" title="Sensible Defaults">
Neovim has a lot of [sensible defaults](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html#nvim-defaults), meaning a lot of the typical settings you might need are already set internally.
