Neovim is a highly customizable and extensible text editor. And although wonderful, it can sometimes be a bit confusing or daunting for newcomers to start configuring.

It's a terminal-based application built for editing and manipulating text, and is also popular among programmers due to its large plugin ecosystem.

Neovim is a modal text editor which is different to most typical applications you might be familar with.

The aim of this guide is to help you understand how Neovim works, why you configure it in a certain way, and how you can get started tinkering with it. At the end of the day, people love Neovim because itâ€™s customisable, and you can make it the exact way that you want.

This guide **will not** be a guide to Vim motions or modal text editing, but on how to use and configure Neovim specifically.

Let's get started!
