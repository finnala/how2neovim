description: How and why to set up a plugin manager in Neovim

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In the previous section we setup the [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager.

To install plugins, you (typically) need to include the name of the plugin inside of the curly brackets `{}` in your `lazy.setup({})` method.

### Lualine Example

Here's an example of how you would install the [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) plugin - a simple statusline for Neovim.

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
    "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim"
})
```

You can then save and quit, and re-open Neovim and lualine will be installed.

Each plugin will include installation instructions in their GitHub repository, as well as information on configuring it.

### Setting Up Plugins

Similarly to how our plugin manager has code to *install* it and code to *set it up*, individual plugins work the same way.

We have just installed [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) - but we still need to **set it up**.

This is as simple as adding the following code to your configuration (e.g. at the bottom of your `init.lua` file, or in `lua/lualine-steup.lua`):

```lua
require("lualine").setup()
```

Each plugin is slightly different to set up, and may have additional options you can configure inside of the setup brackets.

Details for each plugin will be in their relevant GitHub repository.

<Aside type="caution" title="Caveats and Pitfalls To Avoid">
**Module naming** - In your `lua/` directory make sure you don't create filenames which may conflict with each other.

**Ordering of require statements** - Make sure, for example, you have required and set up your plugin manager, before you try to require and set up your plugins.

### Finding Plugins

There is a curated list of plugins at [Awesome Neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) you can use to get started.
