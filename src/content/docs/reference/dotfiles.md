### What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are files in your home directory which tell Neovim what keymaps you want to set, what settings Neovim should have, what plugins you want to use, and more.

Every time you open up Neovim, it will look for these configuration files â€” one of the most important being the init.lua file.
