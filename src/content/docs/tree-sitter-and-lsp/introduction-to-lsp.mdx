description: What the LSP does in Neovim.

The LSP is what you can use to give Neovim extra features that you might associate with VSCode or other ide-like code/text editors.

LSP stands for **Language Server Protocol**. Neovim comes with a built-in LSP **client**, and it uses the language server protocol to communicate with these different **servers** for each language.

These servers make it possible to get features such as go-to-definition, auto-complete and syntax errors (like if you spell something wrong or miss a semi-colon — so you don’t rip your hair out trying to find it).

<Aside type="note" title="Unix Philosophy">
It’s worth noting that these features (e.g. go-to-definiton) don’t always come directly with Neovim when the language server is configured.

It enables the use of features, and you will need to get plugins for each feature that you want.
