Tree-sitter is a parsing tool/library that improves syntax highlighting in Neovim.

Tree-sitter comes built-in with Neovim, and is relatively easy to configure.

### Configuring Tree-sitter

Add the following code to your configuration, e.g. in your `init.lua` or in `lua/treesitter=setup.lua`:

```lua
-- .config/nvim/lua/plugins/treesitter-setup.lua
require("nvim-treesitter.configs").setup({
  -- A list of parser names, or "all" (the five listed parsers should always be installed)
  ensure_installed = { "c", "lua", "vim", "vimdoc", "query" },
  -- enable syntax highlighting
  highlight = {
      enable = true
  }
})
```

Replace the languages in `ensure_installed` with the relevant languages you need. The full list of languages and additional configuration options are available [here](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).

Sometimes you won’t see any noticeable difference in your snytax highlighting until you install a language server (which we will do in the [LSP](/introduction-to-lsp) section).

### Tree-sitter and Colorschemes

When picking a Neovim colorscheme, ensure that it’s tree-sitter supported/compatible — [Awesome Neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) provides a [list of themes](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim#colorscheme) which you can use.
